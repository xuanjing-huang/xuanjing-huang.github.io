I am a Professor at the School of Computer Science, [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), Shanghai, China. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Fudan University in 1998. From 2008 to 2009, I served as a visiting scholar at [CIIR, UMass Amherst](https://ciir.cs.umass.edu/).

As the head of [Fudan NLP Lab](https://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/nlpen/main.htm), I focus on natural language processing and information retrieval, with a particular interest in sentiment analysis, information extraction, pre-trained language models, and the robustness and interpretability of NLP. I have published over 150 papers in major NLP, AI, and IR conferences and journals, with over 14,000 citations according to Google Scholar, My work has been honored with several awards, including an outstanding paper award at ACL 2017, an area chair favorites award at COLING 2018, an outstanding paper award at NLPCC 2019, the best paper award at CCL 2019, and an outstanding paper award at COLING 2022.
