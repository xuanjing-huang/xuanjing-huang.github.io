Recent years have witnessed the great success of large-scale pre-trained language models. However, performing the entire language model for each sample can be computationally uneconomical. Hence, dynamic networks are attracting a lot of attention in the NLP community, which can adapt their structures or parameters to the input samples during inference. In contrast to static language models, dynamic ones enjoy favorable properties such as efficiency, adaptiveness, accuracy, etc. In this talk, I will review recent advances in dynamic networks in NLP and discuss the prospects and challenges of applying dynamic structure to pre-trained language models.
