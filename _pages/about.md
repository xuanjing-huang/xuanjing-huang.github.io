I am a Professor at the School of Computer Science, [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), Shanghai, China. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Fudan University in 1998. From 2008 to 2009, I served as a visiting scholar at [CIIR, UMass Amherst](https://ciir.cs.umass.edu/).

As the head of [Fudan NLP Lab](https://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/nlpen/main.htm), I focus on natural language processing and large language models. I have published over 200 papers in major NLP, AI, and IR conferences and journals, with over 30,000 citations according to Google Scholar. My work has been acknowledged through several awards, including best paper awards at CCL 2019, CCL 2023 and Instruction Workshop @ NeurIPS 2023, an area chair favorites award at COLING 2018, and outstanding paper awards at ACL 2017, NLPCC 2019, and COLING 2022.

I have also made valuable contributions to the research community in addition to my research work. I currently serve as the Chair at [the AACL executive board](https://aaclnet.org/about/index.html), a steering committee member of [SIGIR-AP](http://www.sigir-ap.org/), and a senior action editor of [ACL Rolling Review](https://aclrollingreview.org).
