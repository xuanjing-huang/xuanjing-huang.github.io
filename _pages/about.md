I am a Professor at the School of Computer Science, [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), Shanghai, China. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Fudan University in 1998. I am a visiting scholar at [CIIR, UMass Amherst](https://ciir.cs.umass.edu/) from 2008 to 2009.

I am working on natural language processing and information retrieval, with a particular interest in sentiment analysis, information extraction, pre-trained language models, robustness, and interpretability in NLP. I have published over 150 papers in major NLP, AI, and IR conferences and journals. I have also received an outstanding paper award at ACL 2017, an area chair favorites award at COLING 2018, the best paper award at CCL 2019, and an outstanding paper award at COLING 2022.
